#### Ross Couldrey's Data Blog.  
You like data?  I like data!  We should be friends.

#### What's this all about?
From time to time I'm asked questions by customers, colleagues, friends, etc.  Usually these questions aren't unique and the answers apply to everyone.

Othertimes, I think of interesting things to do with the products I'm working on or solve problems for people that I think could be leveraged by others.

This blog is an attempt to document these things so that others can learn and reuse this information to increase their skills and capabilities.  It's my attempt to give back to a community of people that have helped me grow and learn over the years. 

**After all, knowledge should be free.**

Check out my recent posts below or use the Catories, Tags, or Search capability in the menu bar to help you navigate to what you're looking for.  

Happy reading!
