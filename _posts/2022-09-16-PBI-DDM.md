So lets say you have some text data that you want to analyze in PowerBI.  And lets say that data may contain some Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  You could scrub the data manually, but that takes a lot of time and effort.  So instead, why not utilize the power of Azure Cognitive Services?

In this blog I'm going to walk you through how to create a custom M function in PowerBI that will call Microsoft's Cognitive Services API and mask any found PII data in your text!  

![MaskSample](/assets/images/PBI%20DYnamic%20Data%20Masking/MaskingSampleName.png)

Pretty cool huh?  Lets dive in....

## Prerequisites

Before we get started there's a few pre-requisites you need;

1. PowerBI Desktop Client
2. Access to a cognitive services account
- [Here's a great blog on setting up a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/start-building-with-azure-cognitive-services-for-free/)
3. Some personally identifiable data to mask.  You can either create your own quickly or find a sample online.  This doesn't need to be complicated.

## Getting Started

In order to make this work you'll need to get your endpoint and your API key from your Azure service. Once you have created your congitive services azure resource, these are quite easy to obtain from the overview blade of your Cogntive Services resource in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## Walkthrough

### Step 1 - Create a PowerBI file
Open the desktop client on your machine and import the PII data you have created/downloaded. 
Here's a sample you can use for this demo:

|text|
|------------|
|My SSN is 859-98-0987|
|Your ABA number - 111000025 - is the first 9 digits in the lower left hand corner of your personal check.|
|Bob's phone number is 414-555-6767|


### Step 2 - Add Parameters

Lets create two parameters to help simplify our code.  
In the Power Query editor select "Manage Parameters" then create two new parameters;
- APIKey - which will hold your API Key obtained in the getting started section
- endpoint - which will hold the url for your Cognitive Services endpoint.  It should resemble this format: 
*http://yournamedservice.cognitiveservices.azure.com*

### Step 3 - Create a new M Function
If you've never done this before, we accomplish this by using "Get Data" and "Blank Query" (or if you're in the Power Query Editor use "New Source" then "Blank Query").  I suggest naming your query "maskPII" but you're free to use any name.

Next, open the advanced editor and paste in this M code

```
(text) => let
    endpoint =  endpoint & "/text/analytics/v3.1/entities/recognition/pii",
    jsontext    = Text.FromBinary(Json.FromValue(Text.Start(Text.Trim(text), 5000))),
    jsonbody    = "{ documents: [ { language: ""en"", id: ""0"", text: " & jsontext & " } ] }",
    bytesbody   = Text.ToBinary(jsonbody),
    headers     = [#"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" = APIKey],
    bytesresp   = Web.Contents(endpoint, [Headers=headers, Content=bytesbody]),
    jsonresp    = Json.Document(bytesresp),
    maskedtext  = jsonresp[documents]{0}[redactedText]
    
in
    maskedtext

```

Let's pause for a moment and take a look at this function;

First we pass a parameter called "text" `(text) =>` <- this will be the text we want to scan for PII data.
Next, we define our endpoint.  This is based on the parameter created in Step 2.
- _To call the PII recognition service, we append `/text/analytics/v3.1/entities/recognition/pii` to our personal endpoint._

We then pass our text variable through a series of functions to create our jsontext which will be used in the body.
- `Text.Trim()` will remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
- `Text.Start(text, 5000)` will take only the first 5K characters of our text string.
- `Json.FromValue()` will create a json representation of our trimmed text.
- `Text.FromBinary()` decodes data from a binary value into a text value.

`jsonbody` is where we construct the body of our API call.  Guidance available in the [API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/3.1preview4/entities-recognition-pii/entities-recognition-pii?tabs=HTTP)

Next we define the headers required (also obtained from the [API documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices-textanalytics/3.1preview4/entities-recognition-pii/entities-recognition-pii?tabs=HTTP)) which include our APIKey (remember we set this parameter in Step 2).

`bytesresp` is where we issue the API call via the `Web.Contents` function, by providing the endpoint, the headers and the contents.

At last we can retrive our json result and convert it to a JSON document with `Json.Document`.

Now the only thing left to do is extract the data we want from our json.  We can do that with `[documents]{0}[redactedText]` which extracts the redactedText element from the first object inside documents.

Simple right?

### Step 4 - Bring it all together
Now the magic happens.

Go back to your imported data (query) in the Power Query Editor, select "Add Column" and then "Invoke Custom Function".  Select your function and point it at the column which contains your data.

## Next Steps

In this blog I demonstrated how to call Azure Cognitive Services to mask PII data in PowerBI one line at a time.  However, if you're considering using this on larger datasets, you'll likely want to take advantage of batch processing.  Cognitive Services will allow you to submit 1000 documents at a time in a single request.  Thus, you'll want to batch your requests in groups of 1000 to ensure you're being efficient with your API calls (free services are limited and paid services charge you for number of calls).

There's a great blog on [The Excel Club](https://theexcelclub.com) which demonstrates how to batch requests for a different Cognitive Services API [check it out](https://theexcelclub.com/extract-key-phrases-from-text/).

Here's the M code you'll need for this;
```
(Source as table) as any =>
let
    url =  endpoint & "/text/analytics/v3.1/entities/recognition/pii",
    JsonRecords = Text.FromBinary(Json.FromValue(Source)),
    JsonRequest = "{""documents"":"&JsonRecords&"}",

    JsonContent  = Text.ToBinary(JsonRequest),
    headers     = [#"Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key" = APIKey],
    bytesresp   = Web.Contents(url, [Headers=headers, Content=JsonContent]),
    jsonresp    = Json.Document(bytesresp)
in
    jsonresp
```

Happy PowerBi'ing!
