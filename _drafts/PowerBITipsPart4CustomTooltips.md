Welcome to the fourth installment of this multi-part blog series on simple tricks to increase the usability of your PowerBI reports. In this blog I'm going to demonstrate how to leverage custom tooltips to your visuals to add some extra information and panache!

If you missed any of the earlier installments of this series you can find links to them at the end of this post.

## Setup
For this demo I am using the Contoso Sales for PowerBI dataset that is available for download from Microsoft's site:

But you can also use your own data or report and follow along with this series as none of the enhancements we'll be making to our reports are data dependent.

## Custom Tooltips

Custom tooltips allow us to expand the information provided in a visual by creating a report page that will be used as the tooltip.  This provides almost endless possibilities to report developers to improve on out of the box visuals.  Provide your users with more information using custom tooltips.
